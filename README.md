- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @summerfences
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, cars (i.e. Honda, Toyota, Lancia), DSLR photography, and skramz
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Java, and Italian; I'm also looking to brush up on Spanish and MySQL. I really want to pick up where I left off years ago with C/C++ at some point in the future as well...
