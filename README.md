- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @summerfences
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming (Particularly Python), DSLR Photography, Hondas, and the skramz lyfe. I'm super interested in data structures and algorithms, and am currently studying them in university. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kivy, Java, Latin, and Italian; I occasionally work to brush up on my Spanish, while MySQL and C are two pieces of faded knowledge that I hope to dust off again in the near future!
