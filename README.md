- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @summerfences
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming(Particularly Python and brushing up on my years-lost C++ knowledge), DSLR Photography, Hondas, and the skramz lyfe. I'm super interested in data structures and algorithms, and am currently studying them in university. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kivy, C++ SFML, and Italian; I occasionally work to brush up on my Spanish, while MySQL and C are two pieces of faded knowledge that I hope to dust off again in the near future! Although not particuarly a favorite, I'm currently studying concepts in university by utilizing Java, which I am also fairly comfortable with.
