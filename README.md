- ðŸ‘‹ Salve, Iâ€™m @summerfences! My name is Frank, and I'm currently a BS Computer Science student. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming (particularly Python and C/C++), the SKRAMZ LYFE, DSLR photography, and Hondas.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a few different Python Libraries like Django, Kivy, and Pygame. In university my coursework is written in Java, so I'm inevitably familiar with and learning aspects of Java libraries as a byproduct. MySQL is currently on the backburner, but I'd really like to "dust off" my years-past knowledge base in the near future. I also study Latin and Italian when I'm not working on programming concepts.

    Vale!
